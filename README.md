# What Is This

This is a very simple library to print out to the terminal as if it was being typed by a keyboard. Time span of every key (or string!) is left to the programmer. An example csv and a test/test.c file is given so you can see how to use this library.

# Future Plans

I might add a randomized human like type generator for given strings but not much more unless there is a request for it. However adding human like randomized typing is not a promise since it needs utf8 parsing for basically every system I plan to support. Even though I have another project that does utf8 parsing, I might be too lazy to transfer over the functions.
